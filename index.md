Hey Welcome! 
Here is my Final Portolfio Project for My computer Science Degree
Below you will find a few things: A professional assement, three computer science projects with explanation and links to the code, and a video for a code review. 
Through it all I hope you learn more about myself, my education, and why I could make a valuable memeber of your organization!

Professional Assesment: 
My time in Southern New Hampshire Universities’ computer science program have been extremely valuable. I have learned a lot of skills that will continue to make me valuable in the ever-changing workplace. For my e-portfolio project I focused on engineering tasks that will hopefully be able to propel my career as a product manager forward. Over the course of the last year, I have worked as a Product manager for a tech startup, and I do not think I would be at this point without this program. Throughout my time here I learned data analytics, core software engineering skills, and how to work effectively with technical teams. All while continuing to learn to communicate with stakeholders. These skills will continue to allow me to advance my career as a product manager. Working well with engineers, understanding data well, and high level of communication are the skills that I look most forward to taking with me. 
	During my time constructing this portfolio I focused on showcasing the more technical skills that will make me a great product manager. For my first project I transferred my reverse engineering final into a new coding language. The reason I thought this was worthwhile was because showing that I have skills in working with different types of technologies is critical to the work of a product manager. Then for my next project I am going to refactor my security project with additional data structures and faster algorithms. This will show competency in core computer science fundamentals. Allowing me to better communicate with engineers. My final project will be updating my data mining project with new data grabs SQL injection. I chose this project because I wanted to show I could work with data because a great product manager needs to be data informed. All these projects show my skills in some of the core technical areas for product managers.

Coding Projects:

Project 1: My first project is a conversion of code from assembly to python code. The initial part of the project was created for my reverse software engineering final. It had to do with both security and learning to write in assembly. I am going to take this code and turn it into C++ while also making it run more smoothly. This will show my skills in software engineering. I selected this item because the most important technical skills to a product manager (my chosen career path) is data science and understanding the way different technologies work. Being able to convert a low-level language to high shows my aptitude to understand and learn new technologies while communicating well with engineers. Writing in C++ is the main language for a lot of the technologies I would like to work on someday (gaming/ar/vr) so it gives me more practice and shows my C++ skills. The artifact in C++ will be simpler for other engineers to use while also running much more efficiently than it did with assembly. I want to make a few adjustments to the overall code to run a little better. Right now, there are a few errors that need to be fixed before the final project. However, they seem like relatively easy fixes. Enhancing this project was challenging because I do not have much experience with either assembly or C++. Therefore, I had a lot of questions about the overall syntax of the languages. However, it was fun to learn the new technologies. I got to learn a few new technologies while making sure they are still performing well. [Go to the repo](https://github.com/jordanblanch/cs499proj11/tree/main)

Project 2: The second artifact that I am going to be working on was for my software security course. My job was to take the code for a company and make sure it was secure. However, at the time my current knowledge of data structures and algorithms was lacking. Therefore, I made sure the software was secure but, it does not run very efficiently. Therefore, my goal is to make sure the code will run fast and well. The artifact will use various data structures and algorithms to accomplish both the software’s tasks as well as the security. Through this artifact I will show that I understand proper use of data structures and algorithms. It will also show some knowledge of security for software. For my first milestone I adjusted the data structures of the project but, I still need to adjust some of the algorithms that could work more efficiently. I liked working on this project so far. It is fun to get code working and then try to refactor it to make it run better. The hardest part is trying to implement new algorithms that I have yet to use. I have enjoyed learning about the optimal search and security algorithms. I think once I adjust a few more pieces of my algorithms I will achieve the goals needed.

Project 3: My final artifact is my final for my data mining course. It takes in data through a SQL database and then answers questions around that data. My career choices are in product management which uses data analytics as a strong tool. I currently work as a data scientist on a product team so working with data is a core skill set that I wanted to show off. For the project, I increased data collected as well as the content of reporting. I think this will show my skills in data science of well. I met most of the requirements for this project but, I want to include a little more data collection. Once, I update that I will be all finished up. This was the easiest project for me as It is the closest to what I do day in and day out. However, there was still some SQL queries I didn’t know, and it was fun to work on that skillset more.
